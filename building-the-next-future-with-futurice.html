            Together with our clients, we are building the next future. There’s
            not much in the way of flying cars and jet packs (for the time
            being...), but there’s plenty of strategic thinking, technological
            mastery, artificial intelligence opportunities and human-centered
            design.<br /><br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Fritz Lang’s Metropolis, premiered in Berlin in 1927, was the first
            full-length sci-fi movie. It’s influence on how we see the future
            still reverberates 90 years later in movies, design, fashion and
            probably how we conceive technological progress and its impact - for
            good and bad - including the first humanoid robot. It’s the starting
            point for many of the futures we’ve imagined since then.<br /><br />
          </p>
          <p>
            The future we live in is very different from what we see in
            Metropolis or the works it has influenced, from the Blade Runner
            movies and Star Wars to Janelle Monae albums and Karl Lagerfeld
            designs. In the words of Paul Valéry, “The future, like everything
            else, is no longer quite what it used to be.”<br /><br />
          </p>
          <p>It’s different - not worse, just different.<br /><br /></p>
          <p>
            It’s 2019 and we may not have jetpacks, lunar colonies, flying cars
            and humanoid robots like the Maschinenmensch in Metropolis, but we,
            too, are bringing together the human and the machine. We work on
            creating the next future with robotics, AI, data science and XR.<br /><br />
          </p>

          <p>
            As people who have a passion for the future, traditional nostalgia
            is not something we can draw on for cohesion and strength, so, this
            summer, we’ll draw on nostalgia for what the future used to be - the
            more stylish and exciting aspects of it. We’ll explore all the ways
            in which we can build a future as awesome as the ones we’ve seen
            reflected in art over the last 90 years.<br /><br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Like Metropolis before it, Futupolis, our vision of the future and
            city within a city, will have its first night in Berlin. We’ll
            explore a new future and put our mark on it. The future will be more
            than it used to be.<br /><br />
