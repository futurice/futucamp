            The human species has entered an era where the ability to conquer
            and loot no longer guarantee the survival of a civilization.
            Instead, we are faced with a question: Will we be able to join
            forces in cooperation to prevent environmental, societal and
            economic collapse? Or do we become a colossal wreck like Ozymandias

            In the second century, an author named Lucian of Samosata wrote what
            could be interpreted as the first recorded science fiction story in
            human history. In his novel, A True Story (Ἀληθῆ διηγήματα), Lucian
            sets out to satirize the ludicrous and reality-defying claims
            occasionally found in ancient sources and invents space exploration
            and interplanetary warfare as a byproduct.<br /><br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Science fiction has since blossomed into a genre of its own, also
            known as 'the literature of ideas', tackling concepts related to
            advanced technology, extra-terrestrial life and the consequences of
            scientific innovations. As the world is passing through a
            transition, with futuristic ideas materializing as tangible
            solutions at an unparalleled speed, science fiction has likewise
            evolved and is no longer concerned with the question of 'Are we
            alone'. Instead, the genre increasingly offers up works depicting
            intergalactic cooperation against a common threat.<br /><br />

            So we look to the stars and ask ourselves: What can we do together
            to survive, when neither sky, nor technology, is the limit? In June,
            the stars will look back at FutuCamp and silently answer.<br /><br /><br />
